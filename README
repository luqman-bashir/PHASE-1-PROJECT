### **By Luqman Bashir**

## Description
The Video App is a web application that allows users to manage a collection of educational videos. Users can search for videos, add new ones, edit existing entries, and delete videos they no longer need. The app features a clean, responsive UI built using Bootstrap, with JavaScript handling the logic for video management, and a JSON server simulating the backend.

## Installation
Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Install Node.js
JSON Server: This will serve as your mock backend.
Steps

Navigate to the project folder:

Copy code
cd video-app
Install JSON Server globally if you haven't already:


Copy code
npm install -g json-server
Start the JSON Server:

Copy code
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
This will host the mock database on http://localhost:3000.

## Run the application:
